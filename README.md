# Speech Recognition App

This is an app, where you can recognize your speech, see it on the screen, delete and start from the begining. You can choose any language in language select and download it in pdf (if English is selected) 
and in txt format.

DOM Manipulation: Created and updated HTML elements dynamically (e.g., language options, results display).
Event Handling: Managed user interactions (e.g., button clicks) to start/stop recording and trigger downloads. `

`2. Browser APIs: 
window.SpeechRecognition: For speech recognition functionalities. Used to handle speech input and process it into text

These technologies collectively support recording, converting, displaying, and downloading spoken text in multiple formats.
